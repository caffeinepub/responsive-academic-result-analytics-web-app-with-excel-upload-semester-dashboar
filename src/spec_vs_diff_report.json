  "summary": "Diff shows new state/ref and an effect in SemesterDashboardView to auto-scroll a Student Data Sheet wrapper into view when selectedRollNumber changes. However, due to truncation, the diff summary does not provide enough direct evidence that clicking a roll number inside BacklogDistributionPanel (or selecting from the failed-students dropdown) actually sets selectedRollNumber and renders the StudentDataSheetPanel / Student Not Found panel accordingly.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Clicking any roll number button inside Backlog Distribution shows the Student Data Sheet panel (or Student Not Found) for that roll number, and auto-scrolls it into the viewport; the failed-students dropdown selection continues to work and also scrolls the panel into view.",
      "reason": "Auto-scroll-on-selection is implemented (useEffect on selectedRollNumber), but the diff snippet is truncated before showing the actual render of StudentDataSheetPanel, any Student Not Found panel, and the wiring from BacklogDistributionPanel roll-number clicks and the failed-students dropdown to setSelectedRollNumber. Therefore the core interaction requirements cannot be confirmed from the provided diff evidence.",
