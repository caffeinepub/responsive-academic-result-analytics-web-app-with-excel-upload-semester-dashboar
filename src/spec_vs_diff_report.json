  "summary": "The diff adds a new StudentResultLookupCard with roll-number search, Enter-to-search, clear/reset behavior, inline not-found messaging, and department-aware lookup behavior (search filtered dataset first, then optionally detect existence in full dataset to show a department-specific message). One potential AC gap is the lack of an explicit input label text \"Hallticket No / Roll No\" (only placeholder/description are visible in the snippet). The diff summary also indicates several additional changes (Excel parsing modes, chart changes, adding xlsx/CDN, placeholder hooks) that are not requested by REQ-5/REQ-6.",

      "reason": "In the added lookup card, the input shows a placeholder \"Enter Hallticket No / Roll No\" and the card description mentions the text, but the diff snippet does not show a dedicated visible label element with the exact label text.",
