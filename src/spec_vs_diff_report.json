  "summary": "BacklogDistributionPanel was updated to render roll numbers as clickable controls and to expose an onRollNumberSelect callback prop, but the provided diff snippet for SemesterDashboardView is truncated before showing whether the callback is wired up and whether clicking from Backlog Distribution actually drives the existing StudentDataSheetPanel selection flow.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Clicking a roll number in Backlog Distribution sets the selected roll number in dashboard state and displays the existing StudentDataSheetPanel populated with that student's record (including 'Student Not Found' behavior), without breaking existing failed-student selection behavior.",
      "reason": "BacklogDistributionPanel now emits roll-number clicks via a callback, but the diff for SemesterDashboardView is truncated before any evidence of passing the callback to BacklogDistributionPanel and rendering StudentDataSheetPanel based on that selection. The 'Student Not Found' state behavior is also not evidenced in the shown changes.",
