  "summary": "REQ-4 (scrollable failed-students list) appears implemented via a max-height + overflow scroll on the failed-students Select dropdown content. REQ-3 (subject code + derived abbreviation shown everywhere subject codes appear in Dashboard UI) is partially implemented in Subject Analysis list and some Student Data Sheet logic, but the diff evidence does not confirm coverage for all required locations (notably visualizations and all subject-code instances such as backlog badges / subject-wise results table rendering). The diff summary also indicates several unrelated frontend changes (department filtering, Excel parsing enhancements, chart behavior changes, dependency additions) that were not requested.",

      "requirement": "Display a short subject-name abbreviation alongside each subject code everywhere subject codes are shown in the Dashboard UI (Subject Analysis list items, Student Data Sheet backlog badges + subject-wise results table, and visualizations). Must be consistent and safe when subject name missing.",
      "reason": "The diff shows abbreviation formatting added and used in SubjectAnalysisList and computed in StudentDataSheetPanel, but does not provide evidence that (a) Student Data Sheet backlog subject badges and the Subject-wise Results table actually render the formatted codeWithAbbrev, and (b) visualization labels (e.g., bar chart labels) use the same formatted label. SemesterDashboardView is truncated and chart components shown are not modified in the provided modified-file list.",
