# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Automatically bring the Student Data Sheet panel into view when a roll number is selected in Subject Analysis > Backlog Distribution.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Backlog Distribution roll number click behavior to show the Student Data Sheet (or Student Not Found) for the selected roll number.
- After roll number selection (from Backlog Distribution and the existing failed students dropdown), automatically scroll the page so the Student Data Sheet panel is within the viewport.

**User-visible outcome:** When a user clicks a roll number in Backlog Distribution (or selects one via the existing failed students dropdown), the Student Data Sheet for that student is shown and automatically scrolled into view without manual scrolling.
